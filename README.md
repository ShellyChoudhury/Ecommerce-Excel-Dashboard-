# Ecommerce-Excel-Dashboard-
## Objective

Developed a  dashboard in Excel using Ecommerce data. The data of the Ecommerce dashboard contains a .csv file of 1077111 records. I have created an interactive dashboard using a combo box from the Developer tab. The dashboard displays side-by-side bar plots and bar plots along with other interactive features.

As we choose the product category from the combo box drop-down menu, the total sales, quantity, and profit change.
